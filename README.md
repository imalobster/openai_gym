# openai_gym
This repository contains code related to SIT215 Artificial and Computational Intelligence final project.

## Installation Instructions
Download the Jupyter notebook file named 'project.ipynb' and execute it in your preferred Jupyter notebook environment (I personally use it in vsCode with the extension).

It will require the following standard and data analysis Python modules to be installed and loaded in your current Python environment:
- gym (used for OpenAI environments)
- math (used for random functionality)
- numpy (used for numpy arrays)
- seaborn (used for plotting)
- pandas (necessary to plot regplots)
- matplotlib (to provide additional funcitonality to seaborn)
- sklearn (for the KBinsDiscretizer function)

Once the Jupyter notebook has been loaded into your desired IDE, simply run all cells from the top. The output will be shown on the outputted graphs. Feel free also to play with the hyperparameters.
